# Backend:

- Fetching data from database and save into an array.

- Unset the array after there are changes with data. Fetching data again from database to show updated changes to the User Interface.

- Use a lot of JOIN statements using SQL to get complicated data

# Hosting

- Used Linux machine running technology from XAMPP (Apache) which loads our changes automatically. 

- Our index.php file is not in the root folder, so we wrote .htaccess file using Regex to redirect our web page to the index page.
